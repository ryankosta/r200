# R200

The R200 is the second edition of my cpu project. My cpu projects are a personal project to learn more about computer architecture and how basic cpus fit into the greater scheme of overall computing.

## Project Goals
- Convert architecture to Pipeline
- Support full RV32I instruction subset
- allow system to run gcc-developed code
- implement loading code from a non-memory source such as SPI

## Personal Goals : learn
- Basic pipelined design and overcoming hazards
- ideal verilog coding styles for ease of reading and synthesizability
- what cpus require to run compiled code
- basic MMU development

## Inspirations and teaching resources I used
